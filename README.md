HW 1 Review sheet - If you know all of the terms or concepts on this review sheet you will likely be able to ACE the HW and master the respective skills associated with it.

-- Master the content in the daily in class activities. 
Activity 1-2 Terminal mastery - be able to be in the right folder for using git ! Use git and git hub to push repo up for submission and periodically pushing to git hub throughout for back upGit push pull commit add . 
Activities 3-7 - Basic HTML and CSS - how to make and style an html document 
Activities 8-11 CSS positions and making a layout: CSS positioning : relative, absolute fixed , z index, floats/clears 

HOMEWORK 1 SKILL: Be able to look at a screen shot and make it come to life on a web page (this is exactly how real work is done - a web designer gives you a screen shot and says go make it happen)
Option easy = build a web design skeleton using HTML/CSS
Recommended = you'll build a professional portfolio site using HTML/CSS

Layout Hint:  make a skeleton of the whole site using placeholder images and background colors to just show where each piece will go to get the spacing right. You can even draw it on a piece of paper , nav, header, main basically look at the OPTION EASY and just make something like that for the recommended one then style it later

HTML 
Be able to make a basic html document with all the necessary elements required to load in a browser from memory. i.e. doctype, html, body, head, meta etc.

notes: 
- `doctype` can be upper or lowercase it exists b/c other types of documents exist like xhtml or other types of docs so it just lets the browser know what type of document is coming through the pipeline in our case always html
-in `<html lang="en-us" >` the lang attribute below makes online translator screen readers know what language to go for not required
- `<meta charset=“utf-8”>` tells the browser to make sure to use proper characters when rendering the page - like not using Russian or Japanese symbol here - very first thing -in head some servers set it for you but don’t depend on it 
 
Master these elements :
p, div, h1, h2, h3, a, img, nav, header, section, footer, form, input, ul, li, label, textarea

Remember to know about all the ‘attributes’ of each tag!

CSS 
Know the difference between ‘class’ &  ‘id’ and what is specificity and inheritance (cascade) in css and even check out ‘!important’

Know how to link a css file with a relative path or url. Know what is a reset file http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ for ? 

Know how to really play around with the Chrome dev tools for testing/debugging styles - its much faster than refreshing your page each saved css change - just do it in chrome dev tools when it looks good copy it over to the style sheet. 

Maybe know what is the difference between block level element and inline element to understand behavior of certain elements while building a layout.

Understand what the concept of a wrapper element for styling does (also known as a container) i.e. group children elements and have control over their position/styles etc.  ex: <div class="container"> … why would you use this and so forth?

padding, margin, background (it has many uses even background: url("../images.png”)), float, width (read up on width by percents), color, clear, overflow, height, font-size, font-family, font-weight, display, overflow,  text-align, text-decoration, max-width, min-width, line-height, border
